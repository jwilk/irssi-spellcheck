irssi-spellcheck (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Gabriel Pettier ]
  * New contributor.
    + Add info in copyright and authors.
  * New experimental feature: use a separate split window to display
    spelling suggestions. Add the following variables:
    + spellcheck_window_name to declare which window to use, if any;
    + spellcheck_window_height to declare height for the window.

  [ Brian C. Lane ]
  * Add a command to adds words to personal dictionary.

  [ Jakub Wilk ]
  * Document the split window feature.
  * Document the /SPELLCHECK_ADD command.
  * Improve error handling.
  * Refactor the language-choosing code.
  * Change the code indentation, for consistency with some new code and to
    save some vertical space.
  * Remove the “contact” field from the header; keeping it up-to-date was
    inconvenient.
  * Make the “url” field in the header point to the homepage, rather than the
    bitbucket repository.
  * Don't use sentence-like capitalization and punctuation in the header.

    + Update the %IRSSI hash with new contact information.

    + Remove some commented out debug statements.
    + Remove a comment saying it's a “10-minutes hack”.
    + Use “use warnings”.
    + Remove the shebang, as the module is not meant to be used as a script.
    + Move documentation into a separate file.

    dictionary is missing).
  * Replace “spellcheck” with “spell-check” in a few places.
